## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app on mobile and desktop
- See hover states for the interactive element on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Javascript
- Bootstrap

### What I learned

This was my first time incororating bootstrap into a project. I learned how to add padding on the x and y axis and how to do padding top and bottom. This was also my first time using Fetch API in a project after having just learnt it in tutorial and I learned that multiple functions can be nested into on function after experimenting with that.


### Continued development

I will be focusing on using more Bootstrap in my next projects and try some more challenging API projects to get more comfortable with this.
